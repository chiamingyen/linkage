This software requires Numpy ( http://numpy.scipy.org )
     and PyOpenGL ( http://pyopengl.sf.net )

To generate the nth iteration of the L-system for penrose tilings, as
a mechanical linkage, use:
    python penrose.py <n>
which will output the linkage as saved-linkage.txt

To fix all the angles of a linkage and then place a joint at the
center of each rod, as in Junichi Yananose's "Transformable Penrose
Tiling" ( http://www.polyhedra.jp/polyhedron/tr_penrose/zindex.html )
use:
    python transformable.py <linkage-file>
which will again output the linkage as saved-linkage.txt

To simulate linkages, use:
    python main.py [<linkage-file>]
(see http://mit.edu/harold/Public/linkage for more about simulating
linkages)

Thus to simply make a transformable penrose tiling of order 3, you
would do:
    python penrose.py 3
    python transformable.py saved-linkage.txt
and the resulting output would again be in saved-linkage.txt
You could then view and simulate this linkage with:
    python main.py saved-linkage.txt
